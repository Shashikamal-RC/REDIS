    LISTS:-
        - Lists are groups if Strings
        - Sorted by insertion order (last inserted will be on top)
        - elements can be pushed on the head or tail of the list
        - Often used as a producer / consumer query

        Inserting elemets:-
            LPUSH - Insert the new element on the head (left)
            RPUSH - Insert the new element on the tail (right)

            Note:- 
                - A new list is created when LPUSH / RPUSH is ran against the empty key
                - The key is removed from the keyspace, if the list operation empty the list

            Example:- 

                LPUSH mylist "a"
                    "a"

                LPUSH mylist "b"
                    "b" "a"

                RPUSH mylist "c"
                    "b" "a" "c"


        LRANGE :-
            - retuns the specified elements in the list
            - offsets are zero based Indexes
            - Offsets can be Negative indicating that offset starts from the end of the list

                Example:-
                    ["abc", "def", "ghi]

                    LRANGE data 0 -1
                        ["abc", "def", "ghi]
                    
                    LRANGE data 1 2 
                        1) def
                        2) ghi

        LLEN:-
            - LLEN return the length of the list

                LLEN data   
                    3

                If the list is empty, 0 will be returned
        
        LPOP:-
            - Removes and retuens the first element of the list

                LPOP data
                    "abc"

        RPOP:-
            - Removes and returns the last element of the list

        LINSERT:-
            - insert at specific position

                LINSERT list BEFORE "ietm" "item_to_inserrt"
