SCAN and MATCH :- 

    - Iterates the set of keys in the database
    - Returns only the small amount per call
    - Can be used in production because it performs well
    - Takes Cursor / position as a parameter

    Cursor based iteration :-
         
         - The server returns an updated cursor with every call to the command
         - This can be used in the argument of the next call
         - Iteration starts when cursor is set to 0
         - Terminates when cursor returned from server is 0

         SCAN 0

    SCAN Gaurantees:-
        - Full iteration will retrieve all elements that were present in the 
            collection from the start to the end.
        - Never returns any elements that was NOT present in the collection
            from the start to finish

    COUNT options :-
        - COUNT can be defined in a SCAN command to overwrite the default returned per iteration
        - The user can specify the amount of work done at every call
        - Default COUNT is 10
        - COUNT can be changed from one iteration to the next 

            SCAN COUNT 20

    MATCH Option:-
        - Iterate elements that match a pattern specified

            SCAN 0 MATCH something
            SCAN 0 MATCH k*


    Scan with other Data Types:-
        - SSCAN = used with sets, Returns set of set members
        - HSCAN = used with hashes, Returns array of elements with a field and value
        - ZSCAN = used with sorted sets, Returns array of elements with associated score

    KEYS pattern:-
        - Returns all keys that match a specified pattern
        - Should be avoided in production environment

            Supported glob-style patterns:-
                - ? -> H?llo matches hello hallo and hxllo, (one character)
                - * -> h*llo matches hello heeello hdddllo (any no. of characters)
                - [] -> h[ae]llo matches hallo , hello but not hillo
                - [^] -> h[^e]llo matches hallo hbllo but not hello
                - [a-b] -> h[a-b]llo matches hallo and hbllo

            use \ to escape special characters if you want to match them 

            KEYS * 

    RANDOMKEY:-
            Returns random key from the database
