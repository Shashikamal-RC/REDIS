Key - Value Pair commands:-
    $ MSET :-
        - Set multiple keys to respective value
        - Replaces existing values with new ones

            MSET key1 "val1" key2 "val2"

    $ MSETNX :- 
        - sets multiple keys to respective values as long as none of the keys exists
        - will NOT overwrite existing values
        - Will NOT perform even a single key alredy exists

            MSETNX key1 "val1" key2 "val2"

    $ MGET :-
        - Returns values of all the specified keys
        - Nill is returned if the key doesn't hold a value

            MGET key1 key2
        
    $ APPEND :-
        - If key already exists and is a string, the value will be get appended at the end of the string
        - if the key doesn'e exists,it works as SET

            APPEND mykey "string_to_append"

    $  GETRANGE :-
        - Return the substring of a given value
        - Determined by offset start and end 
        - Negative offsets can be used to start from the end of the string

            GETRANGE mykey 0-1

    $ RENAME :-
        - Renames a key
        - Returns error if key doesn't exists
        - if it exists, it is overwritten

            RENAME mykey myrenamedkey

    $ RENAMENX :-
        - renames key to newkey if newkey doesn't exists
        - Returns an error if ket doesn't exist

            RENAMENX mykey myrenamedkey

    $ GETSET :-
        - Automatically sets key to value and returns the old value
        - Returns null when key doesn't exists
        - Can be used with INCR for counting the automatic respective

            GETSET m "myval"

    $ SETEX :-
        - set key to hold a value and timeout after a given amount of seconds
            SETEX mykey 10 "hello"

        Equivalant to 
            SET mykey "Hello"
            EXPIRE mykey 10

    $ PSETEX :-
        - Same as SETEX except that it uses milliseconds instead of seconds

            PSETEX mykey 1000 "hello"

            PTTL is used to get remaining time in milliseconds
    
    $ PERSIST :-
        -Remove existing timeout on a key

            PERSIST mykey
    
    $ SETNX :-
        - Works like set if the key doesn't exists
        - if the key already exists, it will not change that
    
            SETNX mykey "hello"
